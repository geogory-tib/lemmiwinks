# Lemmiwinks a simple messeganing server


This server is really simple. I didn't even bother to use SQLite with this thing because I really don't need it for what I am doing with it.   
I plan on using this server just to message with some friends and have a means to do some from a terminal.   
Everything is sent using JSON objects so it should be easy to make a client from any langauge because json parsers exist for every langauge ever (even fortran)   

## Todo
1. Add TLS support. As of now everything is plain text but once I get all the small kinks worked out TLS will be added tho this thing
2. Add support for websockect connections. So people can use web clients if they want, but I hate the web so I might not do that.
